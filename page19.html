    <p>And as for me , i told i take inspiration from you rite , then even i must have 
        a pic na with you , if i dont show that then it wont be good na , unfortunately i have a very few pics
         with you but even those are in groups , which i couldn't find it , my bad ,, but i reckon there is just 
         one single pic with you , and sometimes just one is enough for a perfect memorable pic , and i got it 
         with Teena in saree , i know rite - lucky me .. and me wearing a air conditioned panche whole day just 
         thinking it doesn't slip down or what if someone steps on the panche antha ,, all that aside , i still got a pic na
         that is important
